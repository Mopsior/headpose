# Head Direction Tracker

Project was created for olympics "Olimpiada Innowacji Technicznych i Wynalazczości" (now "Olimpiada Wiedzy o Wynalazczości") and the project was canceled due to a change in the type of Olympics.
Project is NOT MAINTAINED and is not well documented. To run this, you need to know what you are doing.

## Plans
The plan was to move whole code to Raspberry Pi 4 with own camera (and optimize code for it) and communicate with computer using cables or/and wifi/bluetooth connection. Also made independent from other software like opentrack.
